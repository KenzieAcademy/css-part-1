# Style a Resume: Master
For this activity, you'll need to update the rules in starter_files/style.css in order to get a resume that looks like the one in mock_up.pdf.

Unlike the apprentice level, we'd like you to match a certain result. We've handled alignment for you, so all that remains is to update colors, fonts, borders, etc to match the mock up.

## Fonts
The body and html tag use 'Lato', helvetica, arial, and sans-serif by default.

Other elements use 'Rokkitt', Helvetica, Arial, and sans-serif.

## Colors
The following colors are used throughout the document for text and backgrounds:
- #444 (slate grey)
- #181818 (jet black)
- #cf8a05 (yellow)
- #f3f3f3 (off white)
- #dedede (light grey)

## Borders
- the border that separates the header from the rest of the resume is 2px thick
- borders between each section are 1px thick
